An EventMachine daemon for rotating and submitting mail spools to an application for processing.

Events:
  1. Timer tick -> acquire lock
  2. Lock acquired -> move file
  3. File moved -> transfer to s3, restart timer
  4. Transfered to s3 -> Post to API
  5. Posted to API -> log

To Do:
  - Make sure locking/moving is enough to safely move files
    - Make sure file is not cut in mid-message
    - Make sure postfix does not continue to write to the moved file
